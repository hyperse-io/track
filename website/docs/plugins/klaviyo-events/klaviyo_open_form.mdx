:::tip

**It is important to note the following:**

- Your form must be live in order for it to open.

- When a form has an ongoing A/B test, this API simply triggers the formâ€™s display. It is your A/B testing logic, which is separate, that determines which variation displays.

  If you have an A/B test where a variation of your form has a custom trigger, you will still need to add custom trigger code to your site.

## Parameters

<Property /> `string`

The FormID will be the ID of your form, which can be found at the end of the form editor URL.
